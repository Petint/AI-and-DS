# AI-and-DS
Artificial intelegence and data science projects.
## ds-1
### The basics
* Importing modules (pandas, numpy, pyplot)
* Opening data
* Basic manipulation
### Visualization
* Pyplot histogram
* Calcullations
## Data modeling with sklearn
* Creating training set
* Creating test set
## ds-2
### Cllassification
* K nearest neighbour method
  - we chose a number (k)
  - we check closest neighbours
  - we predict what k could be
  - number of closest neighbours is always odd
* Decision tree
  - Don't use irrevelant arguments
  - 'No way back' (You can only go down the tree)
  - Liast error is best
* Best cut
* Support vector machines
